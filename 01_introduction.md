Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes

### Challanges with traditional IT Infrastructure

- Slow Deployment
- Expensive
- Human errors
- Limited Automation

- Inconsistency

- Immutable Infrastructure
- Idempotent
- Version Control

### Why Terraform?

- Cloud agnostic
- Many providers
- HCL (HarshiCorp Connfiguration Language)
- Declarative
- Terraform State - Maintains the state
- Terraform Import - Import resources created by other IaC tools - Once done, the resource can be managed by Terraform
